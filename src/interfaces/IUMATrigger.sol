/**
 * @notice This is an automated trigger contract which will move markets into a
 * TRIGGERED state in the event that the UMA Optimistic Oracle answers "YES" to
 * a provided query, e.g. "Was protocol ABCD hacked on or after block 42". More
 * information about UMA oracles and the lifecycle of queries can be found here:
 * https://docs.umaproject.org/.
 * @dev The high-level lifecycle of a UMA request is as follows:
 * - someone asks a question of the oracle and provides a reward for someone
 * to answer it
 * - users of the UMA prediction market view the question (usually here:
 * https://oracle.umaproject.org/)
 * - someone proposes an answer to the question in hopes of claiming the
 * reward`
 * - users of UMA see the proposed answer and have a chance to dispute it
 * - there is a finite period of time within which to dispute the answer
 * - if the answer is not disputed during this period, the oracle finalizes
 * the answer and the proposer gets the reward
 * - if the answer is disputed, the question is sent to the DVM (Data
 * Verification Mechanism) in which UMA token holders vote on who is right
 * There are four essential players in the above process:
 * 1. Requester: the account that is asking the oracle a question.
 * 2. Proposer: the account that submits an answer to the question.
 * 3. Disputer: the account (if any) that disagrees with the proposed answer.
 * 4. The DVM: a DAO that is the final arbiter of disputed proposals.
 * This trigger plays the first role in this lifecycle. It submits a request for
 * an answer to a yes-or-no question (the query) to the Optimistic Oracle.
 * Questions need to be phrased in such a way that if a "Yes" answer is given
 * to them, then this contract will go into a TRIGGERED state and p-token
 * holders will be able to claim the protection that they purchased. For
 * example, if you wanted to create a market selling protection for Compound
 * yeild, you might deploy a UMATrigger with a query like "Was Compound hacked
 * after block X?" If the oracle responds with a "Yes" answer, this contract
 * would move the associated market into the TRIGGERED state and people who had
 * purchased protection from that market would get paid out.
 * But what if Compound hasn't been hacked? Can't someone just respond "No" to
 * the trigger's query? Wouldn't that be the right answer and wouldn't it mean
 * the end of the query lifecycle? Yes. For this exact reason, we have enabled
 * callbacks (see the `priceProposed` function) which will revert in the event
 * that someone attempts to propose a negative answer to the question. We want
 * the queries to remain open indefinitely until there is a positive answer,
 * i.e. "Yes, there was a hack". **This should be communicated in the query text.**
 * In the event that a YES answer to a query is disputed and the DVM sides
 * with the disputer (i.e. a NO answer), we immediately re-submit the query to
 * the DVM through another callback (see `priceSettled`). In this way, our query
 * will always be open with the oracle. If/when the event that we are concerned
 * with happens the trigger will immediately be notified.
